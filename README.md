Introduction:

In this project, I have created a website for a restaurant. This website is developed using HTML and CSS . The website is designed to help the customers to view the restaurant's menu, make reservations, and contact the restaurant easily
Website Layout:

The website has a simple and elegant layout which makes it easy for the customers to navigate. The home page of the website displays the restaurant's name, logo and a background image of the restaurant.
